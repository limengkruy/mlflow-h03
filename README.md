# Customer Churn Prediction with AI 🚀

## Overview
Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction Project**! 🎯 This AI-powered application uses the **Telco customer dataset** to predict whether a customer is likely to churn. We’ve built a robust machine learning model using **scikit-learn** and deployed it as a web API using **FastAPI**. Whether you’re an aspiring data scientist, a business analyst, or someone interested in customer retention strategies, this project is for you! 🔍

### 💡 **Why Customer Churn Prediction?**
Customer churn is one of the most important metrics for any business. Predicting which customers are at risk of leaving can help companies take action early—improving customer retention strategies, increasing revenue, and fostering long-term growth. This project applies machine learning to solve a real-world business problem.

## 🚀 How to Get Started

Follow these simple steps to get the project up and running locally:

### 🖥️ 1. Clone the repository:
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/limengkruy/fast-api-h02.git
cd fast-api-h02
```

### ⚡ 2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 💾 3. Train the model:
Run the Python script to train the customer churn model and save it to a `.pkl` file:

```bash
cd modeling
python train.py
```

### 📊 4. MLflow Experiment Tracking

#### API Endpoints
Start MLflow UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Access the MLflow UI at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

### ⚡ 5. Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 🧑‍💻 6. To make predictions, send a POST request to `/predict` with the customer data in JSON format.

#### API Endpoints

- **POST /predict**: Predict customer churn based on the input data.

    Example request:
    ```json
